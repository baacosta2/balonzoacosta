        <h2>Product Purpose</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A vibration dampener is intended to lessen the shock that is produced when the tennis ball strikes the racquet strings during contact. This primarily affects two features of the stringbed: its feel and sound. Because of the dampener, you experience less impact. This is ideal for beginning players because it lessens the annoying feel of mishits. Furthermore, the pinging sound that is audible is diminished to a pop or thud sound.</li>
