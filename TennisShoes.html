        <h2>Product Purpose</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the most crucial pieces of gear for any sport is footwear. The appropriate shoe can offer support, comfort, and even help ward off injuries.
We frequently get asked, "Why can't I wear a running shoe?" The purpose of running shoes is to allow for constant forward motion. For this reason, the outsole of a running shoe is usually flexible. Conversely, tennis shoes are designed for rapid, short lateral (side-to-side, forward, and backward) motions. The two sports are similar, but their movements are very different. Just like a tennis player wouldn't wear running shoes on the court, a hockey player wouldn't wear figure skates on the rink.
Four distinct components are present in every tennis shoe:
Lateral assistance
Outsider
Flat Thick Outsoles
Toe shield

        </ul>
